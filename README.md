# YK2048
Done as a small project with characters Yagami Takayuki and Kaito Masuharu from the video game 'Judgment' by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios

Made image changes from this version of the 2048 game [here](https://github.com/jk-2048/JK2048). All art in this game were made by me.

Originally tweaked from Gabriele Cirulli's code base [here](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)
